-- Write a function minThree that takes the minimum of three elements. 
-- minThree (-5) 7 2 should return -5

-- Write a function middle that takes the middle of three numbers.
-- middle 7 3 5 should return 5. check this with every permutation

-- Without using an if expression, write a function almostMinThree that takes 
-- the average of of the smallest and middle of three numbers. Call existing functions.

-- Write minThreeBetter that doesn't use an if expression.

-- Write a function strangeFunc that takes three numbers, and if their sum is greater 
-- than 100 finds the minimum, and otherwise finds the middle. For instance, strangeFunc 
-- 10 20 30 is 20. strangeFunc 10 20 80 is 10. Call existing functions.
